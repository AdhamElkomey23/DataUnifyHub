✅ TASKS PAGE — Detailed Description & Functionalities

The Tasks Page is your team’s central space to create, assign, and track every task.
It replaces WhatsApp messages, voice notes, and scattered notes with a clean, searchable, and transparent system.

🎯 Main Goals

Keep all tasks visible and trackable — no more forgotten WhatsApp messages.

Allow each team member to choose whether they see:

All company tasks, or

Only their own tasks.

Ensure accountability — everyone knows who’s responsible for what and when.

Provide clarity through task status, deadlines, notes, and comments.

Make updates easy and communication centralised.

🧱 Structure and Layout
1. Header Bar

Page title: “Team Tasks”

Quick actions:

➕ New Task button

🔍 Search box (search by title, assignee, or keyword)

Filter toggle:

[🔘] All Tasks

[🔘] My Tasks Only
(Toggles between showing tasks assigned to everyone vs. only the logged-in user.)

2. Filters Panel (Collapsible)

This allows focused views to quickly find tasks by criteria.

Filter Options:

Assignee (drop-down with all team members)

Status: To Do / In Progress / Waiting for Review / Done / Cancelled

Priority: High / Medium / Low

Due Date: Today / This Week / Overdue / Custom Range

Department (optional): Sales / Operations / Marketing / Accounting

Created By (for admins to track who assigned the task)

3. Task Table or Kanban View

You can display tasks in two ways (choose depending on your app design style):

Option A – Table View (Spreadsheet-like)

| Task | Assigned To | Status | Priority | Due Date | Created By | Last Updated | Actions |
|------|--------------|---------|-----------|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| “Confirm Luxor Hotel Prices” | Zeina | In Progress | High | Oct 9, 2025 | Islam | Oct 6, 2025 | ✏️ 🗑️ 👁️ |

Option B – Kanban View (Column-style)

Columns: To Do → In Progress → Review → Done
Tasks move between columns with drag-and-drop functionality.

Example:
Zeina can drag a task from “To Do” to “In Progress” once she starts working on it.

4. Add / Edit Task Modal

When clicking “➕ New Task” or “✏️ Edit,” a popup window appears.

Form Fields:

Task Title (short and clear)

Description (detailed text area for instructions)

Assign To: Dropdown list of users

Created By: Auto-filled with the creator’s name

Priority: High / Medium / Low

Status: Default = “To Do”

Due Date: Date picker

Attachment (optional): Upload files or voice notes

Notes (optional): Quick additional info

Notify User: Checkbox → “Send notification to assigned person”

Buttons:

✅ Save

❌ Cancel

5. Task Detail View (Popup or Page)

When you click on a task, a full detail view appears showing:

Overview Section:

Task Title

Assigned To (with photo/avatar)

Priority, Status, and Due Date

Description (full text)

File Attachments / Links

Created By & Creation Date

Comments Section:

Users can leave comments, updates, or clarifications.

Each comment shows the username, timestamp, and message.

Example:

Islam: “Please confirm this price with supplier by tomorrow.”
Zeina: “Done, waiting for reply from Ahmed.”

Activity Log:

Tracks all actions on this task (edited, completed, reassigned, etc.)

6. Status & Priority System

Clear color-coded labels:

Status	Color	Description
To Do	Gray	Not started
In Progress	Blue	Work ongoing
Waiting for Review	Orange	Completed but pending check
Done	Green	Fully completed
Cancelled	Red	No longer needed
Priority	Color
High	Red
Medium	Orange
Low	Green
7. User View Control (Very Important)

This is the feature you specifically mentioned — every user should be able to choose whether to see:

Option	Description
All Tasks	Shows everything in the system — visible only to Admins, Managers, or users with that permission.
My Tasks Only	Shows only tasks assigned to the logged-in user.

Implementation Idea:

In the top-right corner, add a toggle switch:

🔘 All Tasks | 🔘 My Tasks Only

The app remembers the user’s last choice when they log in next time.

✅ This ensures users are not overwhelmed by irrelevant tasks but can switch to “All Tasks” when they need a bigger picture.

8. Notifications & Alerts

Automatic notifications make sure nothing is missed:

🔔 When assigned a new task

⏰ Reminder 24h before due date

⚠️ Overdue task alert

💬 When someone comments on your task

✅ When a task you assigned is marked as done

(You can later integrate this with WhatsApp or email notifications.)

9. Sorting and Bulk Actions

Sort by: Due date / Priority / Status / Assigned user.

Bulk actions:

Mark multiple tasks as done.

Reassign multiple tasks to another user.

Delete or archive completed ones.

10. Reports / Summary (optional widget)

At the top or sidebar, show quick metrics:

Tasks assigned to me: 8

Tasks completed this week: 5

Overdue tasks: 2

Pending review: 1

Managers (admins) can see:

Tasks per user (with completion rate %)

Most active users

Delayed vs. on-time completion

✅ Benefits for Your Team

Managers can track performance easily.

Team members focus only on their own list (unless they choose to see all).

Reduces miscommunication and forgotten duties.
