🧭 The Core Problem

Your team’s current issues fall into three categories:

Data fragmentation

Too many Excel sheets (especially pricing ones), spread across drives and people.

No single source of truth.

Price updates are inconsistent or forgotten.

Communication chaos

Tasks are assigned on WhatsApp → easily lost or misheard.

No way to track or confirm what’s done.

No accountability.

Information loss

Contacts are stored in personal phones → impossible to centralise or find.

Important supplier/partner info disappears when staff leave or change phones.

🧱 The Application’s Goal

To create one internal, centralised, private web app that helps your team:

Organize and update company data (prices, contacts, tasks).

Communicate clearly and track tasks reliably.

Access everything quickly and securely from one place.

⚙️ Key Sections (Modules) of the App
1. Dashboard (Home)

Quick overview of what matters today:

Pending tasks

Recent price updates

Contacts recently added or updated

Urgent notes/reminders

2. Price Management

✅ Goal: Replace messy Excel sheets with one clean, searchable price database.

Features:

Table view: Service | City | Category | Price | Updated by | Date

Ability to filter by service type (e.g., Hotel, Guide, Vehicle, Entrance Ticket).

Add/Edit/Delete options with change history (who updated, when).

“Last updated” column to help identify outdated info.

Option to export to Excel (for quoting tools or reports).

3. Contacts Directory

✅ Goal: Store all suppliers, drivers, hotels, partners, and team contacts in one place.

Features:

Table view: Name | Role | Company | WhatsApp | Email | Notes

Filters by category (Hotel, Guide, Driver, Agency, etc.)

Quick-call or WhatsApp buttons.

Tags (e.g., “reliable”, “preferred”, “new”).

Option to upload supplier contracts or rate sheets.

4. Tasks / To-Do Section

✅ Goal: Replace WhatsApp-based task communication with a clear, shared system.

Features:

Each task has:

Title

Description / Voice Note Upload (optional)

Assigned to (team member)

Deadline

Priority

Status (To Do / In Progress / Done)

Notifications for new or updated tasks.

Daily summary (e.g., “Today’s tasks” list).

Comment section under each task for clarifications.

5. Notes / Knowledge Base (optional but powerful)

✅ Goal: Store frequently used info (e.g., SOPs, instructions, internal procedures).

Examples:

“How to contact a driver.”

“How to issue a refund.”

“Guide to creating a tour quotation.”

→ This avoids repeating the same explanations on WhatsApp.

6. User Management & Roles

✅ Goal: Keep data safe and organized.

Roles:

Admin: Full access.

Operations: Can edit prices and tasks.

Sales: Read prices, manage tasks.

Accountant: Read prices, contacts, update payment info.

Tasks pending

Prices updated this week

8. Optional Future Features

Integration with WhatsApp API → send task confirmation or reminders.

AI summariser → convert voice notes into written tasks.

Integration with Google Drive or Sheets to import/export data.

Auto price change alerts (“Price not updated for 30+ days”).
