💰 PRICES PAGE — Detailed Description & Functionalities

The Prices Page is the central database of all your company’s service rates — replacing all scattered Excel sheets.
It ensures everyone (sales, operations, accounting, etc.) works with the same, updated, and verified data.

🎯 Main Goals

Centralize all prices for every service in one clean interface.

Prevent confusion caused by outdated or duplicated Excel sheets.

Allow fast searching, filtering, and updating by any authorized user.

Track every change with version history (so you always know who changed what and when).

Enable easy export or integration with quotations or other internal tools.

Smart Validation:

Prevent saving if required fields are missing.

5. Price History & Logs

Every time someone edits or deletes a price:

The old value is stored automatically.

You can view the change history.

Displayed info in the log:

Date	User	Old Value	New Value	Action
06 Oct 2025	Zeina	80 USD	85 USD	Edit

✅ This avoids confusion and gives transparency.

6. Outdated Price Warning

If a price was last updated more than 90 days ago, a red badge or ⚠️ symbol appears beside it.

Example: “⚠️ Not updated since July 2024.”

You can also add a “Needs Review” filter to help managers quickly see all old prices.

7. Export & Import Functions

Export to Excel / CSV:
One click to download the table with filters applied.
(Useful for sharing price sheets with suppliers or accountants.)

Import Prices:
Upload an Excel/CSV file → system checks duplicates and shows what will be added or updated.
(Optional for later — can be Phase 2.)

8. Permissions & Access Control

Each user’s access depends on their role.

Role	Permissions
Admin	Full access (view, edit, delete, add)
Operations	Add & edit
Sales	View only
Accountant	View only
9. Price Comparison (Phase 2 Feature)

You can later allow the system to:

Compare supplier prices for the same service.

Highlight the lowest or preferred supplier.

Example:
“Aswan Transfer – Toyota Hiace”
